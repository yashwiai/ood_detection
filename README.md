OOD Detection
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This library is used for OOD Detection where a model encounters new
classes at test time that were not seen during training. The goal is to
detect that such inputs do not belong to any of the training classes.

## Install

``` sh
pip install ood_detection
```

## Example Usage

``` python
import numpy as np
from ood_detection.core import OODMetric # imports OODMetric class and other utility functions
```

``` python
train_embedding = np.random.standard_normal((32, 2048))
train_labels = np.random.randint(low=0, high=5, size=(32,))
```

``` python
ood = OODMetric(train_embedding, train_labels)
```

``` python
test_embedding = np.random.standard_normal((32, 2048)) # test embedding from same distribution
scores = ood.compute_rmd(test_embedding) # compute relative mahalanobis distance
print(scores)
```

## Built using NBDev

This OOD Detection library was built in a jupyter notebook with proper
documentation and test cases. These test cases are verified before they
are published to Github Pages, PyPi, Conda etc.

Iâ€™ve written down a [NBDev
Tutorial](https://yashwiai.github.io/ood_detection/tutorial.html)
explaining the thought process of Jeremy Howard and folks at FastAI
behind building it. The tutorial covers about what it can do and how it
is an amazing tool with support for building softwares following the
best coding principles.
